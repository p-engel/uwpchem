# Chem 461 - Physical Chemistry Laboratory
This class gives practical, hands-on experience in applying physical chemistry concepts in
the laboratory. It provides practice in professional scientific writing and editing. It 
lays out more in-depth (and less "cookbook") approaches to analyzing data. This repository
focuses more on the data analysis as it provides an introduction to statistically analyzing
data through scientific computing.

## Reading the data
The first step towards data analysis is to read the data into a variable name 
(or data structure). The following modules can be used:
```
get_OO_Data.py
```
